            <h3>Dango Music Player</h3>
            <p><i>Dango Music Player (DMP)</i> is a music player (wow!). It's designed to be simple yet powerful, with utility for both casual media collectors, users who use streaming services, and power-users with 20,000+ music files in a local collection. Despite still being very much in development, you can try an early version out right now!</p>
            <p>Oh and it's <a href="https://github.com/Dangoware/dango-music-player" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a> (and various other gits) under the <b>AGPL 3.0</b> so you can just build the latest version.</p>
